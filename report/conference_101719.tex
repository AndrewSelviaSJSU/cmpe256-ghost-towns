\begin{abstract}
Quickly compressing the web's scale and heterogeneity into similar communities is an ideal task for large-scale analytic techniques. This project employs the Label Propagation Algorithm to extract communities from web crawl data. These communities are then fed into a post-processing system which identifies websites which are no longer accessible. Communities composed of a large number of inaccessible websites are labeled ``ghost towns''. Taken holistically, this project demonstrates how to evaluate the health of web communities at scale.

\section{Introduction}

One of the Internet's core advantages is its openness. It enables the distribution of free speech at unprecedented scale. Of course, this property also leads to chaos. Making sense of such a large corpus of information is not trivial. Luckily, decades of concerted effort and research have manifested in tools and techniques for processing this information graph.

This project leverages the expertise of others in the fields of web archival, graph community detection, and distributed computing. Its primary aim is to analyze the health of web communities. In this context, the health of a web community is defined as the proportion of sites within a community which are accessible.

\subsection{Related Work}

The primary inspiration which led to this research is the ``Large-scale Graph Mining with Spark'' work performed by Win Suen. In her articles\cite{largeScaleGraphMiningWithSpark1}\cite{largeScaleGraphMiningWithSpark2}, she describes how to detect communities from web archives using label propagation and Apache Spark. Her general approach is leveraged, though many of the gaps are fleshed out with complete implementations. Additionally, a post-processing phase for determining the liveness of sites within a community is introduced.

Clustering is a quintessential aspect of data mining, and there is no lack of research on the topic. Many of the classic algorithms like hierarchical clustering and partitional clustering can be applied to graphs. Other proposed algorithms deal primarily with graph data, like graph partitioning algorithms and spectral clustering (though this has since been generalized to non-graph data).  Spectral clustering is particularly popular, and many comprehensive papers, like those by Fortunato [cite] or Malliaros [cite], include it as a traditional method to cluster graphs. Another such method is the PageRank algorithm that is at the root of how Google determines the order of search results. Although a few sources mention it (like Malliaros [cite]), PageRank has not received the amount of attention spectral algorithms have, perhaps because of the patent on it held by Stanford University. Another popular algorithm is the label propagation algorithm (LPA). Seemingly the least renown of the three, LPA is not as widely recognized as PageRank or spectral clustering. However, according to Raghavan et al, LPA can run in linear time, saving a lot in terms of computational complexity. Compared to spectral clustering, which is computationally expensive for larger datasets, and PageRank, which is better at determining page importance than finding communities, LPA is the most fitting algorithm for this project.

\section{Architecture}

The solution described in this paper is composed of four primary parts described in detail within this section:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item CommonCrawl: The web crawl dataset
	\item Preparer: An application which maps raw WARC data to a graph from which communities are detected
	\item Reaper: An application which detects dead websites so that ghost towns can be discovered
	\item Visualization: Visualizations derived from various graph rendering tools
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Community Detection}

Approaches like hierarchical clustering, k-means clustering, and label propagation can be employed to detect communities. This project focuses on label propagation due to its built-in support within GraphFrames: a graph processing library built atop Apache Spark.

The combination of Spark and GraphFrames enables rapid iteration. Spark provides distributed data processing, critical when working with large-scale web archive data. GraphFrames, built directly upon Spark's DataFrame API, elevates this project further by handling all the core graph representation duties. Furthermore, it provides a ready-made implementation of the Label Propagation Algorithm.

\subsection{CommonCrawl Data}

CommonCrawl\cite{commonCrawl} provides free, off-the-shelf web crawl data dating back 7 years. Access is simple since the entire dataset is hosted on AWS S3. One need only choose a month's web crawl and a subset to retrieve. The results described in this paper utilize a single file from the February 2020 crawl.

Importantly, CommonCrawl vends the data in Web Archive (WARC) format. This highly-compacted representation encodes a full request and response transaction for each URL visited during the crawl. Though efficient for storage and transmission, WARC demands special care to process.

\subsection{Preparer}

Data preparation responsibilities are apportioned to Preparer: a novel application which takes raw WARC data as input and outputs communities derived from LPA. Custom-built for this project, it is the primary integration point. It is written in Scala and built with SBT.

Raw WARC data is processed via ArchiveSpark: software which enables ``efficient data processing, extraction, and derivation for archival collections,''\cite{archiveSpark} most-commonly web archives. Preparer utilizes its APIs for converting WARC data to CDX format. This translation taps into ArchiveSpark's primary advantage: performance. By pre-processing WARC data into CDX format (which only retains metadata), ArchiveSpark is able to perform common operations much faster than if raw WARC data was fed through Spark directly \cite{generatingCdx}.

After pre-processing, ArchiveSpark's enrichment functions \cite{enrichmentFunctions} are composed into a functional interface which is then applied over the web archive records. The resulting enrichment extracts all links in the HTML response body for an individual WARC record \cite{linkExtraction}. These links are further refined by stripping away all details from the path except the DNS name. For instance, https://example.com/api/123 would become just example.com. This step simplifies community detection later on.

Each DNS name pair will soon represent an edge in the graph. First, however, the DNS names are flattened distinctly into an RDD and each is assigned a hash ID. These IDs represent the vertices in the graph. The edges are simply mapped to their IDs before being finalized.

With vertices and edges defined, Preparer is now able to leverage GraphFrames to construct a graph. Finally, the LPA implementation provided via GraphFrames is invoked with a maximum iteration value of five. Whether it converges (not guaranteed) or reaches its fifth iteration, LPA will detect communities within the graph by iteratively grouping neighbors which share a common label. In the end, each vertex will be assigned to a label which hopefully aggregates similar sites by considering the links emanating from each. Preparer performs one final operation which groups the vertices by label and sorts each community by size in descending order.

Effort was expended to package Preparer in a single fat jar so it could be run via spark-submit on the SJSU HPC. Unfortunately, even provisioned with two nodes possessing 128GB RAM, Preparer repeatedly hit the timeout limit. Thankfully, it can be operated locally. The results in this paper are derived from a local execution of Preparer which took on the order of one hour to complete. Certainly, given more time for research, the SJSU HPC would be a more efficient environment in which to operate Preparer.

In conclusion, Preparer satisfies its contract of processing raw WARC data through a pipeline which includes LPA to detect communities. Though inspired by Win Suen's process, this procedure is truly novel as her data preparation code is excluded from her report and makes no mention of ArchiveSpark.

\subsection{Reaper}

\subsubsection{Version 1}

To get the HTTP status of a given website, there must be some program to make a HTTP request. The first version of this program was a python script that utilized the requests and URLLib libraries. Reaper version 1 ran serially and processed about 70 URLs per minute, which quickly became a bottleneck for this project. In some attempts to speed up each request, some minor changes was made, like sending HEAD requests instead of full GET requests, using ``http://'' instead of ``https://'', and limiting the request timeout to one second. None of these fixes provided the necessary speed boost, so ultimately the program had to be restructured to run more efficiently.

\subsubsection{Version 2}

The first version of Reaper operated serially, therefore if there exists any website link that does not respond in time, the speed of the script will degrade. It became evident that parallel task distribution is needed. 

Since the sequence of the output by the script does not matter, a Python concurrent futures library was utilized. The speed of HTTP HEAD requests can be boosted up to 350 URLs per minute by using a ThreadPoolExecutor with the max workers set to 15 and connection timeout set to 3 seconds. HTTP HEAD requests are I/O bound task.

Moreover, in order to eliminate false negatives, another similar script was deployed with slight difference: with ThreadPoolExecutor in use with the max workers set to 3 and connection timeout set to 60 seconds, but only requests the URLs that were first seemed downed by the first script. By applying this method, it is observed that approximately 50\% of the false negatives are eliminated. Yet there are a total of 140,000 URLs so additional throughput is still needed.

\subsubsection{Version 3}

With the presentation deadline looming, it became clear that the primary bottleneck to discovering ghost towns was Reaper. In order to perform rapid analysis of communities, it needed to process URLs more quickly. This insight led to a third version of Reaper. This time, the Akka library was chosen for its superb concurrent programming model based on actors. This third version of Reaper is written in Scala, built with SBT, and depends on akka-typed \cite{akkaTyped} and akka-http \cite{akkaHttp}. Functionally, it consumes a list of URLs, making a HEAD request for each, then marks the URL as reachable if and only if the response's status code is neither a 4XX (client error) nor 5XX (server error); if the request times out (with a 60 second limit), the URL is marked unreachable. This repeatable process is distributed to Akka actors running concurrently. With proper tuning, this revised approach is capable of processing over 600 URLs per minute running on a single machine. Of course, with some additional effort, the actor model could scale to additional nodes in a cluster, potentially yielding far higher throughput. Time constraints and overriding priorities prohibited further advances on this front.

Equipped with Reaper in its latest form, ghost towns can be discovered nearly 10 times faster than in version 1. Of course, another key metric by which to judge it is accuracy. In that regard, Reaper is still quite finicky. After careful tuning of timeout values and concurrent processing limits, Reaper is able to catch predominantly true negatives (URLs which are truly unreachable). However, careless configuration such as insufficient timeout lengths or lack of throttling can produce large numbers of false negatives (URLs marked unreachable which are, in fact, reachable). Improved evaluation of Reaper results is an unexplored area of this project. Currently, evaluation is performed manually and judged heuristically. Nonetheless, its current form is satisfactory for the purposes of this research.

\subsection{Visualization}

Running the LPA algorithm yielded about 20,000 different communities. These results are then visualized using the iGraph module in Python. Figure 1 shows a qualitative visualization of community size. A quick inspection indicates that there are many small communities and only a few large communities. Figure 2 confirms this quantitatively. Over half of all communities consist of only one website. Although the largest community has around 15,000 websites, the average community size is 6.3 websites, and the median community size is 2 websites.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
 \centerline{\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{communities_by_size.png}}
 \caption{Communities plotted by size; circle size and community size are directly proportional}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
 \centerline{\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{CommunitySizeDistribution.png}}
 \caption{The distribution of community sizes detected by LPA.}
\end{figure}

On the individual community level, website statuses can be included in the graph. Websites that are down are represented by red nodes while sites that are still up are represented by green nodes. iGraph supports many different graph formats, and some formats visualize HTTP statuses more effectively while other formats are better at showing edges. Figures 3 \& 4 visualizes the same community in two different layouts. The “circle” layout (Figure 3) is very good at displaying website statuses. The reader can get a good idea of the percentage of websites still up. When it comes to modeling the relationships between websites, however, the Fruchterman-Reingold layout \cite{fruchterman1991graph}(Figure 4) does a much better job.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
 \centerline{\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{community-circular.png}}
 \caption{A community displayed in circular layout}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
 \centerline{\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{community_fr.png}}
 \caption{The same community displayed in Fruchterman-Reingold layout}
\end{figure}

Within each cluster, all the websites should have something in common. The results show that LPA can detect super niche communities. Some examples of this are the Indigenous Canadian community, the Pacific-Northwest Motorcycle community, and the French Astrophotography community. These communities are mostly still up, with very few dead links. In line with the goals of this project, the algorithm was able to successfully find some online ghost towns. One example of this is what looks like the Chinese Gambling website community. None of the fourteen websites in this community are still up. It is possible that these websites were terminated or reported.

\section{Results and Findings}
LPA marks similar websites with connections and observable communities can be observed in the graph. Unsurprisingly, one of the largest observed communities contains a plethora of big tech companies: At Figure \ref{fig:tech}, few of these largest communities are centered around facebook.com, weibo.com dahucap.com and so on.

\end{figure}
Next up are the smaller communities shown in Figure \ref{fig:small groups}. Note that they are highly uniform and are very specific.

    \caption{(a)Northwestern Motorcycle Group (b)Canadian Indigenous Group (c) French Astronomy Photography Group}
    \label{fig:small groups}
\end{figure}

To find out which URLs are still active and which ones are dead, a series of targeted community HTTP requests was made to the web hosts. The results of the pings are astonishing and yet satisfying: web pages with higher PageRank scores\cite{ilprints422} are more likely to be alive whereas web sites with low PageRank scores are prone to being inaccessible.

Shady website communities also seem to have a shorter life expectancy. For communities such as the scamming community shown in Figure \ref{fig:dead}, it is easy to tell that they are mostly related to online gambling. As most of the gambling websites are illegal and aim to scam innocent people, it is safe to infer that the phishing websites are expected to be dead very soon as they serve only to scam. Over time, the whole scamming community is hypothetically likely to be eliminated by web indexing companies. This would explain why the community registers as a ghost town in this research.

\section{Conclusion}

The detection of ``ghost towns'' (communities comprised of dead websites) from web crawl data achieves the stated goal of this research. Obviously, this result is only possible due to the rich community of tools and techniques for performing large-scale graph analysis. This project relies heavily on that ecosystem: CommonCrawl, Spark, ArchiveSpark, GraphFrames, Akka, iGraph, Gephi, etc. Thanks to the efforts of members of this academic community, this project is able to add to the literature with a novel discovery.

\subsection{Applications}

Potential applications of the detection of ghost towns include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Alerting: Search engines may want to dynamically de-prioritize or remove sites associated with a ghost town.
	\item Reporting: Historical analysis of web crawl data may reveal newsworthy trends such as technological disruption or cultural change.
	\item Accountability: Citizens concerned about excess government intervention may be able to link ghost towns to nation-state interference and take appropriate action.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Future Work}

Naturally, this research endeavor has merely revealed additional layers to explore. Projects worth investigating include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Improving URL liveness check performance: While Reaper is sufficient for processing a few thousand URLs, a production-grade system would certainly demand higher throughput, accuracy metrics, and resilience.
	\item Larger-scale analysis: Due to time and personnel limitations, this project was not able to rise to true web-scale analysis. Luckily, Preparer is designed and packaged for execution on a Spark cluster. With some additional configuration, it should be possible to run LPA over a larger volume of CommonCrawl data. Of course, such a project would inevitably hit the same bottleneck which hindered this one: Reaper. In order to iterate quickly, Reaper must be advanced.
	\item Algorithm substitution: LPA is not the only community detection algorithm available. It would be highly rewarding to add additional algorithms to GraphFrames for performing community detection. This could be an opportunity to contribute to the same open-source toolkit which enabled this project in the first place, bringing the virtuous cycle full-circle.
