\begin{abstract}
Quickly compressing the web's scale and heterogeneity into similar communities is an ideal task for large-scale analytic techniques. This project employs the Label Propagation Algorithm to extract communities from web crawl data. These communities are then fed into a post-processing system which identifies websites which are no longer accessible. Communities composed of a large number of inaccessible websites are labeled "ghost towns". Taken holistically, this project demonstrates how to evaluate the health of web communities at scale.

\section{Introduction}

One of the Internet's core advantages is its openness. It enables the distribution of free speech at unprecedented scale. Of course, this property also leads to chaos. Making sense of such a large corpus of information is not trivial. Luckily, decades of concerted effort and research have manifested in tools and techniques for processing this information graph.

This project leverages the expertise of others in the fields of web archival, graph community detection, and distributed computing. Its primary aim is to analyze the health of web communities. In this context, the health of a web community is defined as the proportion of sites within a community which are accessible.

\subsection{Related Work}

The primary inspiration which led to this research is the "Large-scale Graph Mining with Spark" work performed by Win Suen. In her articles, she describes how to detect communities from web archives using label propagation and Apache Spark. Her general approach is leveraged, though many of the gaps are fleshed out with complete implementations. Additionally, a post-processing phase for determining the liveness of sites within a community is introduced.

\section{Tools and Techniques}

\subsection{Community Detection}

Approaches like hierarchical clustering, k-means clustering, and label propagation can be employed to detect communities. This project focuses on label propagation due to its built-in support within GraphFrames: a graph processing library built atop Apache Spark.

The combination of Spark and GraphFrames enables rapid iteration. Spark provides distributed data processing, critical when working with large-scale web archive data. GraphFrames, built directly upon Spark's DataFrame API, elevates this project further my handling all the core graph representation duties. Furthermore, it provides a ready-made implementation of the Label Propagation Algorithm.

\subsection{CommonCrawl Data}

CommonCrawl provides free, off-the-shelf web crawl data dating back 7 years. Access is simple since the entire dataset is hosted on AWS S3. One need only choose a month's web crawl and a subset to retrieve. The results described in this paper utilize a single file from the February 2020 crawl.

Importantly, CommonCrawl vends the data in Web Archive (WARC) format. This highly-compacted representation encodes a full request and response transaction for each URL visited during the crawl. Though efficient for storage and transmission, WARC demands special care to process.

\subsection{Preparer}

Data preparation responsibilities are apportioned to Preparer: a novel application which takes raw WARC data as input and outputs communities derived from LPA. Custom-built for this project, it is the primary integration point. It is written in Scala and built with SBT.

Raw WARC data is processed via ArchiveSpark: software which enables "efficient data processing, extraction, and derivation for archival collections", most-commonly web archives. Preparer utilizes its APIs for converting WARC data to CDX format. This translation taps into ArchiveSpark's primary advantage: performance. By pre-processing WARC data into CDX format (which only retains metadata), ArchiveSpark is able to perform common operations much faster than if raw WARC data was fed through Spark directly.

After pre-processing, ArchiveSpark's enrichment functions are composed into a functional interface which is then applied over the web archive records. The resulting enrichment extracts all links in the HTML response body for an individual WARC record. These links are further refined by stripping away all details from the path except the DNS name. For instance, https://example.com/api/123 would become just example.com. This step simplifies community detection later on.

Each DNS name pair will soon represent an edge in the graph. First, however, the DNS names are flattened distinctly into an RDD and each is assigned a hash ID. These IDs represent the vertices in the graph. The edges are simply mapped to their IDs before being finalized.

With vertices and edges defined, Preparer is now able to leverage GraphFrames to construct a graph. Finally, the LPA implementation provided via GraphFrames is invoked with a maximum iteration value of five. Whether it converges (not guaranteed) or reaches its fifth iteration, LPA will detect communities within the graph by iteratively grouping neighbors which share a common label. In the end, each vertex will be assigned to a label which hopefully aggregates similar sites by considering the links emanating from each. Preparer performs one final operation which groups the vertices by label and sorts each community by size in descending order.

Effort was expended to package Preparer in a single fat jar so it could be run via spark-submit on the SJSU HPC. Unfortunately, even provisioned with two nodes possessing 128GB RAM, Preparer repeatedly hit the timeout limit. Thankfully, it can be operated locally. The results in this paper are derived from a local execution of Preparer which took on the order of one hour to complete. Certainly, given more time for research, the SJSU HPC would be a more efficient environment in which to operate Preparer.

In conclusion, Preparer satisfies its contract of processing raw WARC data through a pipeline which includes LPA to detect communities. Though inspired by Win Suen's process, this procedure is truly novel as her data preparation code is excluded from her report and makes no mention of ArchiveSpark.

\subsection{Visualization}

Running the LPA algorithm yielded about 20,000 different communities. These results are then visualized using the iGraph module in Python. Figure X.a shows a qualitative visualization of community size. A quick inspection indicates that there are many small communities and only a few large communities. Figure X.b confirms this numerically. Over half of all communities consist of only one website. Although the largest community has around 15,000 websites, the average community size is 6.3 websites, and the median community size is 2 websites.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \subfigure[Communities plotted by size]
    {
        \includegraphics[width=1.0in]{communities_by_size.png}
        \label{fig:communities_by_size}
    }
    \\
    \subfigure[Community size distribution]

        \includegraphics[width=1.0in]{community_size_distribution.png}
        \label{fig:community_distribution}
    }
    \caption{Community numbers and sizes visualized qualitatively (left) and quantitatively (right).}
    \label{fig}
\end{figure}

On the individual community level, website statuses can be included in the graph. Websites that are down are represented by red nodes while sites that are still up are represented by green nodes. iGraph supports many different graph formats, and some formats visualize HTTP statuses more effectively while other formats are better at showing edges. Figure X2 visualizes the same community in two different layouts. The “circle” layout (Figure X2.a) is very good at displaying website statuses. The reader can get a good idea of the percentage of websites still up. When it comes to modelling the relationships between websites, however, the Fruchterman-Reingold layout (Figure X2.b) does a much better job.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \subfigure[Circular Layout]
    {
        \includegraphics[width=1.0in]{community_circular.png}
        \label{fig:circular_community}
    }
    \\
    \subfigure[Furchterman-Reingold Layout]

    }
    \caption{The same community displayed with two different layouts.}
    \label{fig}
    
\centerline{\includegraphics{fig1.png}}
\caption{}
\label{Figure X2}
\end{figure}

Within each cluster, all the websites should have something in common. The results show that LPA can detect super niche communities. Some examples of this are the Indigenous Canadian community, the Pacific-Northwest Motorcycle community, and the French Astrophotography community. These communities are mostly still up, with very few dead links. In line with the goals of this project, the algorithm was able to successfully find some online ghost towns. One example of this is what looks like the Chinese Gambling website community. None of the fourteen websites in this community are still up. It is possible that these websites were terminated or reported.



\section{Ease of Use}

\subsection{Maintaining the Integrity of the Specifications}

The IEEEtran class file is used to format your paper and style the text. All margins, 
column widths, line spaces, and text fonts are prescribed; please do not 
alter them. You may note peculiarities. For example, the head margin
measures proportionately more than is customary. This measurement 
and others are deliberate, using specifications that anticipate your paper 
as one part of the entire proceedings, and not as an independent document. 
Please do not revise any of the current designations.

\section{Prepare Your Paper Before Styling}
Before you begin to format your paper, first write and save the content as a 
separate text file. Complete all content and organizational editing before 
formatting. Please note sections \ref{AA}--\ref{SCM} below for more information on 
proofreading, spelling and grammar.

Keep your text and graphic files separate until after the text has been 
formatted and styled. Do not number text heads---{\LaTeX} will do that 
for you.

\subsection{Abbreviations and Acronyms}\label{AA}
Define abbreviations and acronyms the first time they are used in the text, 
even after they have been defined in the abstract. Abbreviations such as 
IEEE, SI, MKS, CGS, ac, dc, and rms do not have to be defined. Do not use 
abbreviations in the title or heads unless they are unavoidable.

\subsection{Units}
\begin{itemize}
\item Use either SI (MKS) or CGS as primary units. (SI units are encouraged.) English units may be used as secondary units (in parentheses). An exception would be the use of English units as identifiers in trade, such as ``3.5-inch disk drive''.
\item Avoid combining SI and CGS units, such as current in amperes and magnetic field in oersteds. This often leads to confusion because equations do not balance dimensionally. If you must use mixed units, clearly state the units for each quantity that you use in an equation.
\item Do not mix complete spellings and abbreviations of units: ``Wb/m\textsuperscript{2}'' or ``webers per square meter'', not ``webers/m\textsuperscript{2}''. Spell out units when they appear in text: ``. . . a few henries'', not ``. . . a few H''.
\item Use a zero before decimal points: ``0.25'', not ``.25''. Use ``cm\textsuperscript{3}'', not ``cc''.)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Equations}
Number equations consecutively. To make your 
equations more compact, you may use the solidus (~/~), the exp function, or 
appropriate exponents. Italicize Roman symbols for quantities and variables, 
but not Greek symbols. Use a long dash rather than a hyphen for a minus 
sign. Punctuate equations with commas or periods when they are part of a 
sentence, as in:
\begin{equation}
a+b=\gamma\label{eq}
\end{equation}

Be sure that the 
symbols in your equation have been defined before or immediately following 
the equation. Use ``\eqref{eq}'', not ``Eq.~\eqref{eq}'' or ``equation \eqref{eq}'', except at 
the beginning of a sentence: ``Equation \eqref{eq} is . . .''

\subsection{\LaTeX-Specific Advice}

Please use ``soft'' (e.g., \verb|\eqref{Eq}|) cross references instead
of ``hard'' references (e.g., \verb|(1)|). That will make it possible
to combine sections, add equations, or change the order of figures or
citations without having to go through the file line by line.

Please don't use the \verb|{eqnarray}| equation environment. Use
\verb|{align}| or \verb|{IEEEeqnarray}| instead. The \verb|{eqnarray}|
environment leaves unsightly spaces around relation symbols.

Please note that the \verb|{subequations}| environment in {\LaTeX}
will increment the main equation counter even when there are no
equation numbers displayed. If you forget that, you might write an
article in which the equation numbers skip from (17) to (20), causing
the copy editors to wonder if you've discovered a new method of
counting.

{\BibTeX} does not work by magic. It doesn't get the bibliographic
data from thin air but from .bib files. If you use {\BibTeX} to produce a
bibliography you must send the .bib files. 

{\LaTeX} can't read your mind. If you assign the same label to a
subsubsection and a table, you might find that Table I has been cross
referenced as Table IV-B3. 

{\LaTeX} does not have precognitive abilities. If you put a
\verb|\label| command before the command that updates the counter it's
supposed to be using, the label will pick up the last counter to be
cross referenced instead. In particular, a \verb|\label| command
should not go before the caption of a figure or a table.

Do not use \verb|\nonumber| inside the \verb|{array}| environment. It
will not stop equation numbers inside \verb|{array}| (there won't be
any anyway) and it might stop a wanted equation number in the
surrounding equation.

\subsection{Some Common Mistakes}\label{SCM}
\begin{itemize}
\item The word ``data'' is plural, not singular.
\item The subscript for the permeability of vacuum $\mu_{0}$, and other common scientific constants, is zero with subscript formatting, not a lowercase letter ``o''.
\item In American English, commas, semicolons, periods, question and exclamation marks are located within quotation marks only when a complete thought or name is cited, such as a title or full quotation. When quotation marks are used, instead of a bold or italic typeface, to highlight a word or phrase, punctuation should appear outside of the quotation marks. A parenthetical phrase or statement at the end of a sentence is punctuated outside of the closing parenthesis (like this). (A parenthetical sentence is punctuated within the parentheses.)
\item A graph within a graph is an ``inset'', not an ``insert''. The word alternatively is preferred to the word ``alternately'' (unless you really mean something that alternates).
\item Do not use the word ``essentially'' to mean ``approximately'' or ``effectively''.
\item In your paper title, if the words ``that uses'' can accurately replace the word ``using'', capitalize the ``u''; if not, keep using lower-cased.
\item Be aware of the different meanings of the homophones ``affect'' and ``effect'', ``complement'' and ``compliment'', ``discreet'' and ``discrete'', ``principal'' and ``principle''.
\item Do not confuse ``imply'' and ``infer''.
\item The prefix ``non'' is not a word; it should be joined to the word it modifies, usually without a hyphen.
\item There is no period after the ``et'' in the Latin abbreviation ``et al.''.
\item The abbreviation ``i.e.'' means ``that is'', and the abbreviation ``e.g.'' means ``for example''.
\end{itemize}
An excellent style manual for science writers is \cite{b7}.

\subsection{Authors and Affiliations}
\textbf{The class file is designed for, but not limited to, six authors.} A 
minimum of one author is required for all conference articles. Author names 
should be listed starting from left to right and then moving down to the 
next line. This is the author sequence that will be used in future citations 
and by indexing services. Names should not be listed in columns nor group by 
affiliation. Please keep your affiliations as succinct as possible (for 
example, do not differentiate among departments of the same organization).

\subsection{Identify the Headings}
Headings, or heads, are organizational devices that guide the reader through 
your paper. There are two types: component heads and text heads.

Component heads identify the different components of your paper and are not 
topically subordinate to each other. Examples include Acknowledgments and 
References and, for these, the correct style to use is ``Heading 5''. Use 
``figure caption'' for your Figure captions, and ``table head'' for your 
table title. Run-in heads, such as ``Abstract'', will require you to apply a 
style (in this case, italic) in addition to the style provided by the drop 
down menu to differentiate the head from the text.

Text heads organize the topics on a relational, hierarchical basis. For 
example, the paper title is the primary text head because all subsequent 
material relates and elaborates on this one topic. If there are two or more 
sub-topics, the next level head (uppercase Roman numerals) should be used 
and, conversely, if there are not at least two sub-topics, then no subheads 
should be introduced.

\subsection{Figures and Tables}
\paragraph{Positioning Figures and Tables} Place figures and tables at the top and 
bottom of columns. Avoid placing them in the middle of columns. Large 
figures and tables may span across both columns. Figure captions should be 
below the figures; table heads should appear above the tables. Insert 
figures and tables after they are cited in the text. Use the abbreviation 
``Fig.~\ref{fig}'', even at the beginning of a sentence.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{Table Type Styles}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Table}&\multicolumn{3}{|c|}{\textbf{Table Column Head}} \\
\cline{2-4} 
\textbf{Head} & \textbf{\textit{Table column subhead}}& \textbf{\textit{Subhead}}& \textbf{\textit{Subhead}} \\
\hline
copy& More table copy$^{\mathrm{a}}$& &  \\
\hline
\multicolumn{4}{l}{$^{\mathrm{a}}$Sample of a Table footnote.}
\end{tabular}
\label{tab1}
\end{center}
\end{table}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centerline{\includegraphics{fig1.png}}
\caption{Example of a figure caption.}
\label{fig}
\end{figure}

Figure Labels: Use 8 point Times New Roman for Figure labels. Use words 
rather than symbols or abbreviations when writing Figure axis labels to 
avoid confusing the reader. As an example, write the quantity 
``Magnetization'', or ``Magnetization, M'', not just ``M''. If including 
units in the label, present them within parentheses. Do not label axes only 
with units. In the example, write ``Magnetization (A/m)'' or ``Magnetization 
\{A[m(1)]\}'', not just ``A/m''. Do not label axes with a ratio of 
quantities and units. For example, write ``Temperature (K)'', not 
``Temperature/K''.

\section*{Acknowledgment}

The preferred spelling of the word ``acknowledgment'' in America is without 
an ``e'' after the ``g''. Avoid the stilted expression ``one of us (R. B. 
G.) thanks $\ldots$''. Instead, try ``R. B. G. thanks$\ldots$''. Put sponsor 
acknowledgments in the unnumbered footnote on the first page.

\section*{References}

Please number citations consecutively within brackets \cite{b1}. The 
sentence punctuation follows the bracket \cite{b2}. Refer simply to the reference 
number, as in \cite{b3}---do not use ``Ref. \cite{b3}'' or ``reference \cite{b3}'' except at 
the beginning of a sentence: ``Reference \cite{b3} was the first $\ldots$''

Number footnotes separately in superscripts. Place the actual footnote at 
the bottom of the column in which it was cited. Do not put footnotes in the 
abstract or reference list. Use letters for table footnotes.

Unless there are six authors or more give all authors' names; do not use 
``et al.''. Papers that have not been published, even if they have been 
submitted for publication, should be cited as ``unpublished'' \cite{b4}. Papers 
that have been accepted for publication should be cited as ``in press'' \cite{b5}. 
Capitalize only the first word in a paper title, except for proper nouns and 
element symbols.

For papers published in translation journals, please give the English 
citation first, followed by the original foreign-language citation \cite{b6}.
